# P2P Auction System

This is a CLI P2P Auction System that supports multi-auction biding across peers.

## Usage instructions
1. Open as many instances of the CLI terminal as you want. Each one of those will be a "peer" in the network.
2. Let the CLI guide you by filling up the info required for them to connect. It needs a name (to keep it human friendly on the screen) and a port in which the peer will be running. (At this moment, they are all running on the host machine).
3. Once you see the "Choose your next command" instruction you're good to go. If you need any help, type "help" on the terminal and the list of available commands will be displayed.
4. To confirm all the peers are connected it's useful to run "peer -l". The output from this command should look something like this:
